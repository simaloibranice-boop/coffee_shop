## Domain Model Design (Instruction 2)

I designed three main classes: Customer, Coffee, and Order.
A Customer can have many Orders, and a Coffeee can have many Oders.
An Order belongs to one Customer and one Coffee.
This creates a many-to-many relationship between Customer and Coffee through Order.
